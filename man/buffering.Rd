\title{Use distance (buffer) around records to separate train and test folds}
\usage{
buffering(speciesData, species = NULL, theRange, spDataType = "PA",
  addBG = TRUE, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{speciesData}{A simple features (sf) or SpatialPoints object containing species data.}

\item{species}{Character. Indicating the name of the field in which species data (binary response i.e. 0 and 1) is stored. If \code{speceis = NULL}
the presence and absence data (response variable) will be treated the same and only training and testing records will be counted. This can be used for multi-class responses
such as land cover classes for remote sensing image classification, but it is not necessary. \emph{Do not use this argument when the response variable is
continuous or count}.}

\item{theRange}{Numeric value of the specified range by which the training and testing datasets are separated (See \code{\link{spatialAutoRange}}).
This distance should be in \strong{\emph{metres}}. The range can  be explored by \code{spatialAutoRange}.}

\item{spDataType}{Character input indicating the type of species data. It can take two values, \strong{PA} for \emph{presence-absence} data and \strong{PB} for
\emph{presence-background} data, when \code{species} argument is not \code{NULL}. See the details section for more information on these two approaches.}

\item{addBG}{Logical. Add background points to the test set when \code{spDataType = "PB"}.}

\item{progress}{Logical. If TRUE a progress bar will be shown.}
}
\value{
An object of class S3. A list of objects including:
    \itemize{
    \item{folds - a list containing the folds. Each fold has two vectors with the training (first) and testing (second) indices}
    \item{k - number of the folds}
    \item{range - the distance band to separated trainig and testing folds)}
    \item{species - the name of the species (column), if provided}
    \item{dataType - species data type}
    \item{records - a table with the number of points in each category of training and testing}
    }
}
\description{
This function generates spatially separated train and test folds by considering buffers of specified distance around each observation point.
This approach is a form of \emph{leave-one-out} cross-validation. Each fold is generated by excluding nearby observations around each testing
point within the specified distance (ideally the range of spatial autocorrelation, see \code{\link{spatialAutoRange}}). In this method the test set never
directly abuts a training presence or absence. For more information see the details section.
}
\details{
When working with  presence-background (presence and pseudo-absence) data (specified by \code{spDataType} argument), only presence records  are used
for specifying the folds. Consider a target presence point. The buffer is defined around this target point, using the specified range (\code{theRange}).
The testing fold comprises the target presence point and all background points within the buffer (this is the default. If \code{addBG = FALSE} the bacground
points are ignored). Any non-target presence points inside the buffer are  excluded. All points (presence and background) outside of buffer
are used for training set. The methods cycles through all the \emph{presence} data, so the number of folds is equal to the number of presence points in the dataset.

For presence-absence data, folds are created based on all records, both presences and absences. As above, a target observation (presence or absence) forms a
test point, all presence and absence points other than the target point within the buffer are ignored, and the training set comprises all presences and
absences outside the buffer. Apart from the folds, the number of \emph{training-presence}, \emph{training-absence}, \emph{testing-presence} and \emph{testing-absence}
records is stored and returned in the \code{records} table. If \code{species = NULL} (no column with 0s and 1s are defined), the procedure is like presence-absence data.
